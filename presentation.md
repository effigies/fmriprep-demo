### What is it?
]
.right-column[
## Robust, generic fMRI preprocessing

* Works with the data you give it, imposing minimal requirements
  * You can run it on a T1w scan and a BOLD series

## Standardized

* By adhering to modern data format standards, fMRIPrep can detect
  the available images and prepare outputs that can be used by all
  major software packages (FSL, SPM, etc.)

## Self-documenting

* fMRIPrep generates reports that allow you to detect issues in
  preprocessing

## Brain Imaging Data Structure
* fMRIPrep will run on any BIDS-formatted dataset ([What is BIDS?](https://bids.neuroimaging.io))


### Docker
```Bash
$ pip install fmriprep-docker
$ fmriprep-docker /data_dir /outputs_dir participant
```

### Singularity
```Bash
$ singularity exec docker://poldracklab/fmriprep:latest \
  /data_dir /outputs_dir participant

### Your data

.pull-left[![Example BIDS Dataset](assets/bids.png)]
.pull-right[
* BIDS datasets are organized by subject, modality, and image type.

* fMRIPrep uses T1-weighted images for anatomical preprocessing.

* BOLD series and field maps (if available) are used for
functional preprocessing.

### The pipeline

</div>

---

### Derivatives

fMRIPrep outputs adhere to the
[BIDS Derivatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wwc4A6Mow4ZPPszDIWfCUCRNstn7d_zzaWPcfcHmgI4)
draft specification.

.pull-left[

#### Anatomical

* T1-weighted template
  * INU-corrected
  * Multiple images merged
* Anatomical brain mask
* Tissue probability/class maps
  * Classes: GM, WM, CSF
* T1w â‡„ MNI transforms
* Reconstructed surfaces\*
  * `smoothwm`, `pial`, `midthickness`, `inflated`
* Parcellation and segmentation (`aparcaseg`)\*

.footnote[\* Requires FreeSurfer]

]

.pull-right[

#### Functional

In each output space (e.g., T1w, MNI, surface\*):

* Distortion corrected BOLD series
* BOLD mask
* Confounds (tabular file)
* Non-aggressively denoised BOLD series\*\*
* MELOIC mix (tabular file)\*\*
* ICA-AROMA noise components (tabular file)\*\*

.footnote[\*\* Requires ICA-AROMA]

### Reports

---

Reports describe the data as found, and the steps applied.

<p align="center">
<img alt="Execution and anatomical summary" src="assets/anat_summary.png">
</p>

Textual summaries are good to check for obvious failures, such as missing images or implausible
values.

 data="assets/sub-001_T1w_seg_brainmask.svg">filename:assets/sub-001_T1w_seg_brainmask.svg</object>
</p>

The brain mask report shows the quality of intensity non-uniformity (INU) correction,
skull stripping, and tissue segmentation.

The MNI normalization report shows the quality of the non-linear normalization step.

Skull stripping defects may be more obvious here.

The FreeSurfer subject reconstruction report shows the white-gray boundary
and pial surface overlaid on the T1w image.

The functional summary can vary based on:

1. Available data

template: funcsum
 \- SDC technique depends on the available field maps

2. Metadata - slice-timing correction requires `SliceTiming` metadata entry

3. User selections - `bbregister` requires FreeSurfer, `FLIRT` used otherwise

## Outside contributions

Significant components of current fMRIPrep functionality were contributed by
interested users who had needs we didn't yet support.

Large additions include:

* ICA-AROMA support
* Multi-echo BOLD
* CIFTI2 outputs
* Lesion masking

In addition, we've had numerous bug fixes and documentation updates from users.
